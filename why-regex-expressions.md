# Why use Regular Expressions?

A Regex statement is simple a very finite or more scoped search criteria which is done by using some funky syntax. This can be achieved in coding applications by using expression literals. This statement is not just limited to one programming language and is nearly universal in its application. It is often used to validate passwords, search for text with particular criteria. Explaining this expression can be complicated so lets break it down. 

As a programmer there is a high likelihood you have tried searching through code within your code editor to check how many times and where you have called a certain variable, function, or method. The feature you have used for this is a type of formatted search. A formatted search is just one of many uses of a Regex statement. Using a find tool in a text editor is a literal search. This means that  the given the search criteria that is typed into the search field will be shown the highlighted within your document. The search criteria is chosen as you type in letters or numbers. A great question is how does the search bar work to take in the typed search with the given criteria? This could be done with a regex statement.

## Summary

A great example of a regex statement in real world application is finding or searching for a zip code. The regex offers the specific search. This is the regex statement doing our search. ```^\d{5}(?:[-\s]\d{4})?$``` . This statement is acting upon each component of the statement that we are searching with our regex statement. Each form of the syntax  ```^d{5}(?:[-\s]\d{4})?$```.
